import { Layout } from "../../components";

Challenges:

-

This required navigating Next's SSR vs SSG functionality. The Next.js documentation is really inform'ative for this, with examples that are tailored to this spicific problem.

Notes:

- I hummed and hawed for a bit about whether using MDX is worthwhile, given that I'd like to be able to crosspost content on other sites (Hashnode, for example) which won't accomodate embedded jsx. However, it seemed likely that I'd only use jsx for page layout, so I don't think this is going to be an issue. I'd be interested to hear if anyone is finding this to be a sticking point.
